### Hi there.
This project simply enables you to play the rock, paper, scissors game.
## How it was created
- I imported the python random module
- Created a while loop to enable users play as much as they want
- Declared some variables to call actions
- Added the conditional statements(if, elif and else) to determine whoever win, loss or a tie
- Added the break statement incase the user decides to stop
